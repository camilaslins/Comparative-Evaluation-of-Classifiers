# IN1102 Machine Learning
This repository is for the machine learning course, which is part of the Computer Science postgraduate program at CIn/UFPE. It contains projects focused on evaluating and comparing machine learning classifiers using various methods.

## Description
The project in this repository  activity aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of four classifiers on the preprocessed Wine Quality dataset. The KNN, LVQ, SVM, decision tree, and MLP algorithms were evaluated using cross-validation and statistical techniques, following a randomized search for their optimal parameters.
